# Hi there 👋 I'm Evgenii!

🚀 I'm a software developer with nearly 6 years of experience in smart contract development, auditing, and academic research. I'm passionate about building secure and efficient applications with **Soldity**, **Ethereum**, and **Angular**.  
🎯 My focus: Web3 development, smart contract security, and building full-stack decentralized applications (dApps) that make it to production.
